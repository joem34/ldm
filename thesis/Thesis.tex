Standard socioeconomic variables are not always accurate indicators of destination attractiveness in destination choice models. For example, areas such as ski resorts are significant attractors of long distance trips, yet have small populations and little employment. This thesis presents a destination choice model for long distance travel in Ontario that uses data from the location based social network, Foursquare, to address this issue. Points of interest and their historical check-in counts are collected and processed to define measures of destination attractiveness based on common long distance trip activities. The design, estimation and calibration of the multinomial logit model are covered in detail, and the implemented model used to perform a scenario analysis. The results show that big data can be successfully used to represent destination attractiveness, and that such an approach is particularly effective for modeling long distance leisure travel.
